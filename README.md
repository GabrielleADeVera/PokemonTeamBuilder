# PokemonTeamBuilder App
An app using Prism for CS 481 final project.
Uses pokeapi to get pokemon data to build a 6-pokemon team.
Lists the type strengths and weaknesses based on team composition

##Disclaimer: Used Professor Desmond's Week 9 Example as a template to build this. We just wanted something that worked. Those build errors hurt so much.
